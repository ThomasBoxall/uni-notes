# University Notes

These are my University notes from my undergraduate degree - [BSc (Hons) Computer Science](https://www.port.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/bsc-meng-computer-science) at the [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk).

They exist here, to put it simply, because that's easy for me. I can have a [nice webpage](https://uni-notes.thomasboxall.net) to access them from, and be done with it. No fighting my way into my Google Drive, OneDrive, or some other platform which requires a blood sample to log into. 

Yes, they are typeset using LaTeX because I enjoy it, but also because it's just easier than doing battle with [insert your preferred WYSIWYG editor here]. I commonly use mathematical symbols, code snippets and graphs, sometimes all at the same time; there's no way I'm making that happen elsewhere without loosing braincells.

They're licensed under CC-BY-4.0, attribute back to [the webpage they're hosted on](https://uni-notes.thomasboxall.net) if you want to "borrow" them.

I accept no liability if you read something here, take it for gospel and then get a bad grade because I got it wrong. Read at your own risk.
