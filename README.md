# University Notes

*Repo to store university notes in*

## Big Disclaimer
I am NOT a Computer Science expert. I am a university student who is learning and making mistakes. I cannot be held accountable if my notes are wrong and you get a bad grade because of them!  
If you spot something wrong with my notes, drop me an email or message on Discord.

## How my notes work
This repo contains typeset notes which have been written after the sessions. They have been produced using notes I've taken during the sessions and resources made available by lecturers.   
It may take up to a week for notes from lectures to make their way onto here as I have lots of classes and sometimes non-uni things which need to get done before writing up notes.  
I'm typesetting my notes using LaTeX, with custom colourful boxes and syntax highlighting, made possible by various packages. 

## Folder Structure
`/00-TEMPLATES` contains templates and testing documents for the LaTeX templates. (ignore this folder)  
`/01-FIRST YEAR` contains folders for each module I'm taking. Within each folder there is a .pdf document which contains the full note set. 

## Distribution of my work
Obviously, these aren't quick notes to write. If you pass them onto someone else, please be a decent human and share a link to GitHub where they're attributed to me. I'm putting a lot of effort into making them nice and I will take them offline if they are plagiarized.  

## Links to Notes
See below for links to GitHub Pages of this Repo as GitHub's inbuilt PDF viewer is pretty bad.
