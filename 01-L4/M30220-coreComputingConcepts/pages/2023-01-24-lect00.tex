\lecture{LECTURE: Week 0 \& Introduction}{24-01-23}{13:00}{David}{RB LT1}

This sub-module will use Flipped Learning. There are a collection of videos on Moodle which we will need to watch each week. Lectures will be used to review previous weeks content and metrics based off of quiz scores. The quizzes do not feed into our final grade and can be found on Moodle. Also on Moodle, is a `hotspots' activity which provides additional information which is needed to complete the quiz. 

The lectures will be adapted each week to allow review and consolidation of content.
