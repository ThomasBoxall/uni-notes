T1. Write a query that puts the genre, the author's full name and the titles of the books they have written for all of the action books. The name and title must be displayed in a single column with the heading ``Title and Author''.
\begin{sql}
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', author.authorfname, author.authorlname, book.title) AS "Title and Author", genre.genre FROM author
JOIN wrote ON author.authorid = wrote.authorid
JOIN book ON wrote.wroteisbn = book.isbn
JOIN bookgenre ON bookgenre.isbn = book.isbn
JOIN genre ON genre.genreid = bookgenre.genreid
WHERE genre.genre = 'Action';
\end{sql}

T2. There are some common first names in the author table. Write a query that would return only a single row of data for each individual name.

T3. How many rows of data would be returned by the query in Q2?
\begin{verbatim}
28 rows
\end{verbatim}

T4. How many authors are there in total?
\begin{sql}
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM author;
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo}

\end{pseudo}

T6. Do we have any authors in our system that do not appear to have written any book that we have on the shelves? List their full names, surname first with a comma as a separator using concatenation, giving the column the title of ``Author but no books''.
\begin{sql}
SELECT CONCAT_WS(',', author.authorlname, author.authorfname) AS "Author but no books" FROM author
LEFT JOIN wrote ON wrote.authorid = author.authorid
WHERE wrote.authorid IS NULL;
\end{sql}

T7. List any library users full names and their email addresses that have never taken a book out of the library. Show another piece of data that proves that your query is giving exactly the answer you are asked for.
\begin{sql}
SELECT libuser.fname, libuser.emailaddress FROM libuser
LEFT JOIN loan ON loan.loanlibrarynumb = libuser.librarynumber
WHERE loan.loanlibrarynumb IS NULL;
\end{sql}

JOIN loan ON loan.loanlibrarynumb = lu.librarynumber
JOIN book ON loan.isbn = book.isbn

T15. Create a new role in your DBMS called libadmin and give them the ability to login and set a password for this new role.
