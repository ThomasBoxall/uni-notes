\lecture{Managing Exams and Assessments}{05-12-22}{14:00}{Nadim}{RB LT1}
Whilst preparing for assessments, we have to switch between lots of different things in order to get things done. This is much the same as a CPU in a modern device. The CPU has to do many different things at once, each of which at a different priority level and needing different amounts of time for it. 

If you don't effectively switch between tasks, some tasks will not get done. 

\section*{Reverse Engineering Deadlines}
Not only is this useful to use now for exams and coursework deadlines, it is a good thing to do for the final year project.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Have a calendar which shows when deadlines are.
    \item The few days before the deadline are used for proof-reading the project and getting ready for submission.
    \item The middle part of the timeline (largest) is for the majority of the work to be completed in
    \item The firsts stage (relatively small) is there to be used to test things/ try things out then to plan the middle phase.
\end{enumerate}
