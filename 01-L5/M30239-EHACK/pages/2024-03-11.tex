\section{Exam Preparation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The exam will cover content from week 1 through 5 (inclusive); there will be some vulnerabilities from week 1 and 2, however.
    \item The ultimate aim of the exam is to break the machines to Root access, and there will be a number of questions on Moodle which we will need to answer, some of these will be flag-style and some will require research on the machines and providing an answer.
    \item The `playbook' should contain details on some of the OWASP Top 10
    \item Some geolocation will be expected in the exam
    \item Filtered internet access will be provided, we will be provided with a list of of sites which we can access
    \item We will be breaking a webserver. There might be \textit{other} stuff running on it, however it will definitely be a webserver
    \item The webserver might be running WordPress, it might not.
    \item We will be provided with the \textit{rockyou} wordlist. If an attack using a wordlist is taking a long time then we should assume that it will not provide us the answer.
    \item If a hashcat is taking a long time, we should try other things while it is running
\end{itemize}
