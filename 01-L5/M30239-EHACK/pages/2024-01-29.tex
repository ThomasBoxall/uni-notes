\section{Active vs Passive}
There are two approaches which can be taken to Information Gathering: Active and Passive. The difference between the two is about the contact the hacker has with the target; where in active information gathering - the hacker has direct contact with the target (which will lead to potential discovery by the target of the hacker) whereas in passive information gathering - the hacker does not make direct contact with the target (which is less likely to lead to discovery).\\

Active information gathering makes use of probing the network, social engineering, directory \& share scanning. \\

Passive information gathering makes use of: OSINT, search engines, and physical observations. Passive information gathering also includes activities such as DNS enumeration, which can include using whois, IP address scanning and examining associated devices.
