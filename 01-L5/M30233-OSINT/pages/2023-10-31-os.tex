\section{Processes}
A \textit{process} is a program which is in execution. Processes can either be visible (where the user can see them) or invisible (where they are running in the background) - Task Manager shows both types. Each application which is running in a different window will be running a different process, however, a process is not a program.\\

A program is a passive entity - a sequence of instructions. A process is an active entity - it is doing things, through which it is executing part of the program. Multiple instances of the same application may be running concurrently, each in a distinct process. Processes contain their execution states within them as well as the individual threads which make up the processes.

\subsection{Memory layout Of a Process}
The memory layout of a process is typically divided into multiple sections, including
\begin{description}
    \item[Text Section] the executable code
    \item[Data Section] global and static variables
    \item[Heap] memory that is dynamically allocated during program run time
    \item[Stack] temporary data storage when invoking functions (such as parameters, return addresses and local variables)
\end{description}
The heap and stack can grow and shrink in size within a limited range as all processes have a fixed maximum size.

\subsection{What Makes a Process?}
The execution state of a process includes a program counter (which is the point reached in the program), a stack and a data section. A thread also has these features, however it inherits the data section from the process it belongs to. Alongside threads, processes also contain an address space.

\section{Multitasking}
A major responsibility of the operating system is sharing the physical CPU resource between processes, which is achieved through time sharing. This is when the CPU is allocated in turn to active processes. \textit{Context Switching} is the process of storing the state of a process and switching the CPU to another process - this happens frequently enough that processes appear to run concurrently. The maximum quantum (amount) of time a process runs for before switching might be around 10ms, however this depends on the OS's scheduling policy.  \\

While one process is waiting for an Input / Output (I/O) event, the CPU can be reallocated to another process that has work to do. This improves utilization of the CPU, as this is a limited resource which we need to make the best use of. As well as waiting on an I/O event, the OS can context switch between processes because the current process has been executing on the CPU for the allotted quantum therefor eit needs to give another process a go.

\subsection{Process States}
There are a number of different states a process may be in:
\begin{description}[font=\ttfamily]
    \item[new] the process is being created
    \item[ready] the process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
    \item[running] instructions are executing
    \item[blocked / waiting] the process is waiting for some event to occur (such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal)
    \item[terminated] the process has finished execution 
\end{description}

\end{figure}

The transitions between these processes can be driven by a number of things. Transitioning from \verb|blocked| to \verb|ready| is typically driven from an interrupt from an I/O device. Transitioning from \verb|running| to \verb|ready| is commonly driven by interrupts by the system clock. The transition from \verb|running| to \verb|blocked| commonly has a special kind of interrupt (``trap''). All the interrupts are dealt with by \textit{interrupt handlers} which are installed and managed by the OS. \\

The operating system maintains a data structure (process table) in memory with a slot for every running process. The slot for each process is called a \textit{Process Control Block}.

\subsection{Process Control Block}
A \textit{Process Control Block} (PCB) is a data structure used by the operating system to store information about processes. For processes not presently in the \verb|running| state, a PCB will include: the contents of all machine registers (general purpose registers, program counter, program status word, etc) at the time the process was interrupted; pointers to data structures associated with memory management for the process (this will be covered in more detail in a later lecture); and any other information needed to restore the process in exactly the state it was in when it was last \verb|running|.\\

The PCB does not contain program variables, these are assumed still in the processes' memory.\\

The PCB is used to store the state of the CPU when the CPU context switches to a different process. 

\subsection{Dispatcher}
The \textit{dispatcher}, part of the operating system, gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the scheduler. This has a number of steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stop the currently running process
    \item Store the hardware registers and any other information in that processes' PCB
    \item Load the hardware registers with the values stored in the selected process' PCB and restores any other state information
    \item Switch to user mode
    \item Jump to the proper location in the user program to restart that program
\end{enumerate}

The above steps are collectively known as \textit{Context Switching}.

\section{Scheduling}
Scheduling is what the CPU \& Operating System do to control what process currently has access to the CPU and what order the remaining processes should get access. The thing that controls this is called the \textit{scheduler}. Before a process is selected to run next on the CPU, the scheduler needs to address the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When should the CPU be given to another process?
    \item What scheduling policy is being used? (Under what circumstances should the CPU be given to another process?)
    \item What scheduling mechanism is being used? (How long and in what order should the CPU be given to another process?)
\end{itemize}
The above mentioned questions will all be answered by the \textit{scheduling algorithm}.\\

When a process is ready to run - it conceptually is part of the \textit{ready queue}. The scheduler assumes all processes are in memory and it will select a process from the ready queue and allocate the CPU to it. The ready queue is usually implemented using a \textit{linked list}, comprising of pointers to process control blocks. It may be ordered by priority, however this is optional. Each Input / Output device also has their own queues - these differ from ready queues as this is where the process is put while it is blocked waiting on I/O. There are also many process queues associated with semaphores etc.

\section{System Calls}
The \textit{user programs} (applications) run in processes. The scheduler and other parts of the operating system will run in their own time slices, which are sandwiched between the time slices of user processes. While a user process is actively executing on the CPU - the CPU is in \textit{user mode} (it has a limited set of instructions which can be used); and when the Operating System is directly executing on the CPU - the CPU is in \textit{kernel mode} (any instruction can be performed without question). This means that there needs to be a mechanism for a user program to request that a kernel mode instruction is performed. This mechanism is called a \textit{system call}.\\

To software developers - system calls look like ordinary function calls, however rather than performing an action in the software - they invoke an Operating System function such as creating new processes or performing input \& output. In UNIX and OSs derived from it, there are only a few dozen system calls. These are standardised in POSIX - in a sense, the system calls define the OS. However, in true Microsoft fashion - Windows has may more.\\

It's all well and good the CPU being able to call these kernel mode instructions while in user mode however this somewhat defeats the point. Instead, the function call made by user programs can't directly change the processor to kernel mode - rather a \textit{software interrupt (trap)} is raised. This is handled similarly to a hardware interrupt. The trap is a mechanism of transition. Once a system call is made, its handler may call into a \textit{device driver} that talks to some I/O device or when a data transfer completes - a hardware interrupt goes through another entry in the interrupt table and eventually the user process is rescheduled. The Operating System initially populates the interrupt table with suitable kernel mode handler functions. This is done by the \verb|LIDT| instruction on Pentium systems.\\

In a sense, the operating systems interrupt handlers run the whole kernel. Any switch to kernel mode that triggers kernel OS activity starts with an interrupt of one form or another, which is followed by a jump to a table belonging to an interrupt handler. All phases of process scheduling are handled by interrupts.
