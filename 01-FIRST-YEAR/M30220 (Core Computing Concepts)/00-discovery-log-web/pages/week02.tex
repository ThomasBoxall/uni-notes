To remove the scrollbar present in some browsers, add the line \texttt{margin:0;} to the \texttt{body} CSS styling.

Sometimes you will need to specify the last of a type, to do this use \texttt{p:last-of-type {  }}. This would select the last \texttt{<p>} tag and allow that to have different styling, for example a different amount of padding or a different bottom border.

The \texttt{unset} property applied to width will reset the value so that its inherited from its parent.
