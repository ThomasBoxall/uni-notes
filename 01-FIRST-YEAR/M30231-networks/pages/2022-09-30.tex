This session will usually be taught by Amanda, it's being covered by Taiwo today.

This session is more of an introduction to practical sessions and a information gathering session than a taught session.

We were asked to answer the following questions about our experience of networks.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have you upgraded a computer previously?
    \item Have you built a wired network previously?
    \item Have you built a wireless network previously?
    \item What are you expecting to learn in this module?
\end{itemize}

The wireless access point (WAP) in the room is located behind the projector. WAPs are wired devices which broadcast wireless signals.

RJ-45 connectors are the common connectors on the end of a Cat 5/5e/6 cable.

RJ-11 connectors are the smaller version of RJ-45 which is commonly used for telephone cables.

We will learn lots oof concepts, which will be covered in exams.

We then completed a scenario based exercise thinking about delay, reliability and duplication of tasks on a network.
