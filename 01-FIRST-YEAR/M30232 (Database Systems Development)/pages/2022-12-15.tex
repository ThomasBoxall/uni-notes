Regardless of the scenario, we have to start with picking out the entities for the Entity Relationship Diagram. 

If there is something which happens to an entity, for example a service, then if you store that data in the entity, you won't be able to view information about that event once it is overwritten. You have to store the event in a different table.

There should never be entities which are not connected/ related to any other entities in the ERD.

\section*{Coursework Advice}
If you have 20-30 entities, you've broken down the coursework too much. Somewhere between 6 and 11 is the right number.
