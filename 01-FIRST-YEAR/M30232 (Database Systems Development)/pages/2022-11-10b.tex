\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect to the \texttt{dsd\_22} Database
\item Drop the \texttt{dsd\_22} database using the code shown below and show the output below.
\begin{sql}
DROP DATABASE dsd_22;
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}
ERROR:  cannot drop the currently open database
\end{pseudo*}
\item If you were unable to drop the database, how did you do it? Show your code below.
\begin{sql}
\c up2108121
DROP DATABASE dsd_22;
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}
DROPPED DATABASE
\end{pseudo*}
\item Create the table but do not create any tableofcontents
\begin{sql}
CREATE DATABASE dsd_22;
\end{sql}
\item Exit Postgres client but don't close connection to the VM
\item Download the code from Moodle
\item Use SCP through the terminal to copy the file to the virtual machine
\item Run the code to populate the database
\item Connect to the \texttt{dsd\_22} database.
\item Check that the tables have been created with the \verb|\dt| command and to check that there is data in each of them, select the number of rows in each table.
\begin{pseudo*}
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM category;
 count
-------
     6
(1 row)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cust_order;
 count
-------
   150
(1 row)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer;
 count
-------
    11
(1 row)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM manifest;
 count
-------
   150
(1 row)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product;
 count
-------
   100
(1 row)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM role;
 count
-------
     5
(1 row)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staff;
 count
-------
    10
(1 row)
\end{pseudo*}
\item Get a printout of the structure of each table by using the \verb|\d| command.

\item Look at the printout for the question above and find the category of the product "Multi-layered multi-tasking initiative"
\item Use the following command to narrow down the search
\begin{sql}
select * from category, product where prod_name = 'Multi-layered multi-tasking initiative';
\end{sql}
When we don't join tables properly, the output we are given is called a `Cartesian Product'. This is bad.
\item Run the following code
\begin{sql}
select * from category
join product on category.cat_id = product.prod_cat;
\end{sql}
