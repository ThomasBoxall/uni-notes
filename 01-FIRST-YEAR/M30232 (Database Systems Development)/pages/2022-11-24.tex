\begin{enumerate}
    \item FROM \& JOIN (chose and join tables to get base data)
    \item WHERE \& SUBQUERY/ INTERSECTION/ UNION/ EXCEPT (filters the base data)
    \item GROUP BY (aggregates the base data)
    \item HAVING (filters the aggregated ata)
    \item SELECT (returns the final data, as functionality not displayed)
    \item ORDER BY (sort the final data)
    \item LIMIT (limits the returned data to a row count)
    \item display data
\end{enumerate}

4. Get the structure of the tables customer and cust\_order using the \verb|\d| command. Copy the code and the answer below.
\begin{pseudo*}
dsd_22=# \d customer
                                        Table "public.customer"
   Column   |          Type          | Collation | Nullable |                  Default

\end{pseudo*}

5. According to the answer from question 4, what are the names of the attributes in both tables that are the primary key and foreign keys? (hint - look at the section “Foreign-key constraints:” that appears in one of your outputs. Remember we are looking at customer and cust\_order)\\
customer pk - cust\_id\\
cust\_order pk - cust\_ord\_id\\
cust\_order fk - cust\_id\\
cust\_order fk - staff\_id

6. List all of the categories. Copy the query and the answer below.
\begin{sql}
SELECT * FROM category;
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}
 cat_id |  cat_name

      1 | Men's Wear
      2 | Ladies Wear
      3 | Kid's Wear
      4 | Outdoor
      5 | Sport
      6 | Health
(6 rows)
\end{pseudo*}

7. What is the id number for the category Sport? Copy the query and the answer below.
\begin{sql}
SELECT cat_id from category where cat_name='Sport';
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}
 cat_id
--------
      5
(1 row)
\end{pseudo*}

8. Write a query that joins the product table and the category table and prints out the prod\_name and the appropriate category. Copy the query and the answer below. (You can copy the just first screen of data if you want)
\begin{sql}
SELECT product.prod_name, category.cat_name FROM product
JOIN category ON category.cat_id = product.prod_cat;
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}
                    prod_name                     |  cat_name

9. Write a query that will list each staff member's first and last name along with their work email and the role name that they hold. Copy the query and the answer below.

\end{pseudo*}

10. Write a query that will show the last name and the role of staff members who put together orders from the customer whose last name is Eke. Include the cust\_order\_id and the customer's first and last names. Copy the query and the answer below.
\begin{sql}
SELECT staff.staff_lname, role.role_name, cust_order.cust_ord_id, customer.cust_fname, customer.cust_lname FROM staff
JOIN role ON staff.role = role.role_id
JOIN cust_order ON cust_order.staff_id = staff.staff_id
JOIN customer ON customer.cust_id = cust_order.cust_id

\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}
 staff_lname |    role_name    | cust_ord_id | cust_fname | cust_lname

\end{pseudo*}

11. Write a query that lists only the category names and the custome's last names for orders that have been placed by people who live in Sunbu. Copy the query and answer below.

\begin{sql}
SELECT customer.cust_lname, category.cat_name FROM customer
JOIN cust_order ON customer.cust_id = cust_order.cust_id
JOIN manifest ON cust_order.cust_ord_id = manifest.cust_ord_id
JOIN product ON product.prod_id = manifest.prod_id
JOIN category ON category.cat_id = product.prod_cat

\end{pseudo*}

12. This is a bit harder than the previous queries. Try to group the orders and count the number of orders in each category for the results from q11. (hint - this might be a bit difficult. Grouping does not allow a WHERE, use HAVING instead). Copy the query and answer below.
\begin{sql}
SELECT customer.cust_lname, count(category.cat_name), category.cat_name FROM customer
JOIN cust_order ON customer.cust_id = cust_order.cust_id
JOIN manifest ON cust_order.cust_ord_id = manifest.cust_ord_id
JOIN product ON product.prod_id = manifest.prod_id
JOIN category ON category.cat_id = product.prod_cat
GROUP BY customer.cust_lname, category.cat_name, customer.town
HAVING customer.town='Sunbu';
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}
 cust_lname | count |  cat_name
------------+-------+-------------
 Douthwaite |     1 | Kid's Wear
 Douthwaite |     2 | Ladies Wear
 Douthwaite |     3 | Outdoor
 Douthwaite |     4 | Sport
