\section*{Tutor Led}
We need to insert two more roles into the \texttt{Role} table.
\begin{sql}
INSERT INTO ROLE (role_name)
VALUES ('Cleaner');

INSERT INTO ROLE (role_name)
VALUES ('Pre Sales');
\end{sql}
Then run the following.
\begin{sql}
SELECT count(*)
FROM ROLE;
\end{sql}
This generates the following output
\begin{pseudo*}
 count 
-------
     7
(1 row)
\end{pseudo*}

\section*{Student Tasks}
1. Write a query that correctly displays the staff members first and last names, their email addresses and their roles. Use the method that uses the \texttt{JOIN} keyword. Copy the code and answer below.
\begin{sql}
SELECT staff.staff_fname, staff.staff_lname, staff.home_email, role.role_name FROM staff
JOIN role on staff.role = role.role_id;
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}
 staff_fname | staff_lname |         home_email          |    role_name

2. Rewrite the query created in 1 but this time use the \texttt{WHERE} keyword. Copy the code and answer below.
\begin{sql}
SELECT staff.staff_fname, staff.staff_lname, staff.home_email, role.role_name FROM staff, role
WHERE staff.role = role.role_id;
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}

6. How can you prove that the product id is being used to do the ordering? (You may have already done this in Q5). Copy the code and the answer below.
\begin{sql}
SELECT category.cat_name, product.prod_name, product.prod_id FROM category
JOIN product ON product.prod_cat = category.cat_id
ORDER BY category.cat_name, product.prod_id;
\end{sql}
\begin{pseudo*}
  cat_name   |                    prod_name                     | prod_id
