\lecture{Reviewing Previous Work}{04-10-22}{13:00}{Nadim}{RB LT1}

Historically, one of the biggest weaknesses to previous coursework submissions was the lack of knowledge of how it was graded. 

For an animated video, look at Powtoons.

You are able to use AI voice generators to speak the script, however this is a risk as its not your voice on your submission. If you do use an AI voice, you must submit the script as a PDF to prove it is your own work.

The following list are things which were included in examples that I think are the attributes of high scoring videos
\begin{itemize}
    \item Present the video as an argument, with one side then respond to it from the other perspective;
    \item Lift quotes out of the conversations and question, elaborate and research around them;
    \item Use evidence for all points
\end{itemize}

Th argument analysis included after each conversation is new for this year and the use of it won't loose or gain marks. It is there to give guidance for those who are unsure of where to start otherwise.
