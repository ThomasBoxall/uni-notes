Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), a subset of Uniform Resource Indicators (URIs) allow us to navigate throughout the internet. They take the following form:
\begin{verbatim}
https://port.ac.uk/
http://www.example.com/forum/questions/?tag=networking&order=newest#top
\end{verbatim}
They can be typed into an address bar, hyperlinked or used as the \verb|src| attribute on elements.
